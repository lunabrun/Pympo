## Writing a Bachelor/Master Thesis at the Data Engineering Systems Group

This is the proposal template for writing a thesis at our group.
It is a very basic template that tries not to restrict you but lets you focus on writing.

The thesis proposal clearly describes the topic and goal of the thesis and serves as a discussion basis for the advisor and the candidate. 
The proposal should be at least 4 pages and not more than 6 pages (including the title) and include references to the state of the art. 
The proposal template is a proposed structure with the core elements that should be in the proposal. 
You can use a more fine granular structure if you want to.
The texts can serve as a basis for the thesis and must not contain any plagiarism.

### How to Use the Template
The template consists of the main `proposal.tex` file, a folder for the individual sections, and a folder for the images that you use.
It contains only very basic packages, so it should probably work with most Latex distributions and Overleaf.

In the `proposal.tex` file, you can set a few variables at the beginning of the file that then fill your cover page.
