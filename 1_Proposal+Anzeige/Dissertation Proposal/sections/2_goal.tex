\section{Goal of Thesis}
\label{sec:goal}

%Description of the concrete problems addressed as the goals of the thesis, planned/expected results, reference to other thesis, paper, etc., if any.

The objective of the proposed dissertation is to elaborate a fatigue model for ceramic \ac{FDP}.
This model shall consider not only the long-term effect of the functional loads (e.g. mastication), but also the adverse effect on the support of the implant due to bone loss caused by peri-implantitis.

The \ac{FE} structural model will be verified via simplified analytic calculations and validated via \emph{in-vitro} experiments. 
Finally, \ac{SN} curves will be obtained experimentally for \ac{Y-TZP} and used to validate the created fatigue model.
These curves will be obtained both for the conditions with and without the influence of peri-implantitis.
This influence will be represented via a reduced base support of the dental implant.
