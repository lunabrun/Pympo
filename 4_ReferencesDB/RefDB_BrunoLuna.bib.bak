For example, it considers a eletropolished material probe only! So probably not really comparable with a grit blasted implant!!!

Also focused on very high cycle fatigue, to be checked (see ISO norm) if number of cycles considered in its SN curve is realistic.},

  abstract     = {The topic of titanium alloys for dental implants has been reviewed. The basis of the review was a search using PubMed, with the large number of references identified being reduced to a manageable number by concentrating on more recent articles and reports of biocompatibility and of implant durability. Implants made mainly from titanium have been used for the fabrication of dental implants since around 1981. The main alloys are so-called commercially pure titanium (cpTi) and Ti-6Al-4V, both of which give clinical success rates of up to 99% at 10 years. Both alloys are biocompatible in contact with bone and the gingival tissues, and are capable of undergoing osseointegration. Investigations of novel titanium alloys developed for orthopaedics show that they offer few advantages as dental implants. The main findings of this review are that the alloys cpTi and Ti-6Al-4V are highly satisfactory materials, and that there is little scope for improvement as far as dentistry is concerned. The conclusion is that these materials will continue to be used for dental implants well into the foreseeable future.},

  abstract     = {Dental implants experience rare yet problematic mechanical failures such as fracture that are caused, most often, by (time-dependent) metal fatigue. This paper surveys basic evidence about fatigue failure, its identification and the implant’s fatigue performance during service. We first discuss the concept of dental implant fatigue, starting with a review of basic concepts related to this failure mechanism. The identification of fatigue failures using scanning electron microscopy follows, to show that this stage is fairly well defined. We reiterate that fatigue failure is related to the implant design and its surface condition, together with the widely varying service conditions. The latter are shown to vary to an extent that precludes devising average or representative conditions. The statistical nature of the fatigue test results is emphasized throughout the survey to illustrate the complexity in evaluating the fatigue behavior of dental implants from a design perspective. Today’s fatigue testing of dental implants is limited to ISO 14801 standard requirements, which ensures certification but does not provide any insight for design purposes due to its limited requirements. We introduce and discuss the random spectrum loading procedure as an alternative to evaluate the implant’s performance under more realistic conditions. The concept is illustrated by random fatigue testing in 0.9% saline solution.},
  comment      = {As always, good article by KSV and DR.
Random Spectrum load for fatigue is a good idea, but without real life characterization, I do not see it as useful as stated in the paper.

Many citable information.
Examples:

Service conditions for dental implants vary a lot, so that it makes almost impossible to set average or representative conditions (our approach so far!!!)

Low stiffness of Ti Alloys (most widely used is the Ti6Al4V) brings it closer to stiffenes of the bone. This matching reduces stress gradients.

See refs. 1 and 9 for values of mastication or bite forces. Loads vary from 100N to 2400N.

Monotonic overload has not yet been reported as being the case for failure of a dental implant

Fatigue here used in the sense of repeated/sustained load, not necessary cyclic!

Fatigue cracks initiated in stress concentrations areas such as threads in thin metal sections. Also grit blasting may be a cause.

Strucural health aspects to detect size of fatigue crack before failure almost non-existent for dental implants! See SIIRI project by professor Stiesch as an effort to change this. Obviously difficultis due to limited visual inspections and hazards due to X-Rays. Obvious market gap!!! Start-up? :)

Suggestion for study with Prof. Stiesch and Dr Greuling: Mechanical test of implants taken due to biological reason from patients and test them for mechanical cracks and failure! Ideally with correlations to patients, so that an addition in relation to the study by KSY and DR could be made.

Dental implants in area of high cycle fatigue.

Accuracy of Palmgreen Miner ruler and assumptions for it use are more or less ok but already challenged in the literature.

ISO 14801 ok for comparative purposes, but not much than that. Mainly only the fatigue limit is determined. Therefore, not possible to obtain a cumulative damage-based estimate.

Assumption is that ultimately all dental implants fail by fatigue, once the biological failures have been overcome. Question is only: when?

Spectrum also uses the concept of "standard package of loads" as the one we are planning, only that the package is random...

How is the spectrum actually created? See Ref. 35 for details.},

  abstract        = {This paper investigates the influence of surface preparation treatments of dental implants on their potential (mechanical) fatigue failure, with emphasis on grit-blasting. The investigation includes limited fatigue testing of implants, showing the relationship between fatigue life and surface damage condition. Those observations are corroborated by a detailed failure analysis of retrieved fracture dental implants. In both cases, the negative effect of embedded alumina particles related to the grit-blasting process is identified. The study also comprises a numerical simulation part of the grit blasting process that reveals, for a given implant material and particle size, the existence of a velocity threshold, below which the rough surface is obtained without damage, and beyond which the creation of significant surface damage will severely reduce the fatigue life, thus increasing fracture probability. The main outcome of this work is that the overall performance of dental implants comprises, in addition to the biological considerations, mechanical reliability aspects. Fatigue fracture is a central issue, and this study shows that uncontrolled surface roughening grit-blasting treatments can induce significant surface damage which accelerate fatigue fracture under certain conditions, even if those treatments are beneficial to the osseointegration process.},

  abstract        = {The fatigue performance of dental implants is usually assessed on the basis of cyclic S/N curves. This neither provides information on the anticipated service performance of the implant, nor does it allow for detailed comparisons between implants unless a thorough statistical analysis is performed, of the kind not currently required by certification standards. The notion of endurance limit is deemed to be of limited applicability, given unavoidable stress concentrations and random load excursions, that all characterize dental implants and their service conditions. We propose a completely different approach, based on random spectrum loading, as long used in aeronautical design. The implant is randomly loaded by a sequence of loads encompassing all load levels it would endure during its service life. This approach provides a quantitative and comparable estimate of its performance in terms of lifetime, based on the very fact that the implant will fracture sooner or later, instead of defining a fatigue endurance limit of limited practical application. Five commercial monolithic Ti-6Al-4V implants were tested under cyclic, and another 5 under spectrum loading conditions, at room temperature and dry air. The failure modes and fracture planes were identical for all implants. The approach is discussed, including its potential applications, for systematic, straightforward and reliable comparisons of various implant designs and environments, without the need for cumbersome statistical analyses. It is believed that spectrum loading can be considered for the generation of new standardization procedures and design applications.},

A total number of 15 implants for the static test and 112 implants for the cyclic-fatigue test. In the cyclic test, the machine ceased operating when the structure collapsed or when it reached 5 × 10(6) cycles without apparent failure. The load versus the number of cycles was plotted as curves for biomechanical analysis (S-N curve) for each implant diameter. The S-N curve plotted for the 5 mm implants showed classic fatigue behavior with a finite life region starting from 620N. The same was observed for the 3.75 mm diameter implants, with a finite life region starting below 620N. By contrast, the 3.3 mm diameter implants failed to show predictable fatigue behavior and a fatigue limit could not be defined. The results of this study emphasize the importance of implant diameter on fatigue behavior. Narrow implants failed to show typical fatigue behavior which might be attributed to the implant design.},

Eighty fractured dental implants were analyzed after being tested for fatigue performance. A macroscopic failure analysis was performed, which evaluated and located the fracture modes obtained, followed by a microscopic failure analysis comprising a detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractographic analysis. Four distinctive fracture loci were identified and macrofracture mode analysis was performed, showing that all 5-mm implants that fractured were fractured at the abutment neck and screw. In the 3.75-mm group, 44.4% were fractured at the implant neck and 55.5% at the implants second thread. Fifty-two percent of the 3.3-mm fractured implants had it at the implants second tread and 48% at the implants third thread. The implant's metallographic sections revealed that the different fracture loci were located where thin metal cross sections and sharp notches coexist. Using SEM, we were able to characterize the failure micromechanisms and fatigue characterization as transgranular fracture and arrays of secondary parallel microcracks at relatively low magnifications and classic fatigue striations at much higher magnifications. The results of this study indicate that proper implant design is crucial to ensure long-term fatigue performance for dental implants. The combination of sharp notches (thread) and narrow metal cross section is quite deleterious for fatigue resistance.},

  abstract        = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of fluid environment mimicking intra-oral conditions on fatigue performance of standard diameter, 3.75-mm implants. Dental implants placed intra-orally are repeatedly submitted to mastication loads in the oral environment, which differ substantially from room-air standard laboratory conditions. Several studies that examined fracture surfaces of intra-orally fractured dental implants have identified corrosion fatigue as the main failure mechanism. Yet, fatigue performance of dental implants has been essentially studied in room air, based on the premise that the implant material is relatively resistant to corrosion in the intra-oral environment. Thirty-two 3.75-mm titanium alloy implants were tested under cyclic compressive loading. The tests were performed in artificial saliva substitute containing 250 ppm of fluoride. The loading machine stopped running when the implant structure collapsed or when it completed 5 × 10(6) cycles without apparent failure. The load vs. number of cycles was plotted as curve for biomechanical fatigue analysis (S-N curve). The S-N curve plotted for the artificial saliva test was compared to the curve obtained previously for the same implants tested in a room-air environment. Failure analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A comparison of the S-N curves obtained in artificial saliva and in room air showed a considerable difference. The S-N curve obtained in the artificial saliva environment showed a finite life region between 535N and 800N. The transition region was found below 465N, with a probability of survival of 50%, while in room air, the transition region was between 810N and 620N and an infinite life region below 620N was identified. The results of this study show that environmental conditions adversely affect implants' fatigue performance. This fact should be taken into account when evaluating the mechanical properties of dental implants.},

Relatively few studies have systematically addressed the potential influence of the environment on the mechanical integrity of the implants, which is therefore the subject of this study. Four media (groups) were selected for room temperature testing, namely dry air, saliva substitute, same with 250ppm of fluoride, and saline solution (0.9%). Monolithic Ti-6Al-4V implants were loaded until fracture, using random spectrum loading. The study reveals that the only aggressive medium of all is the saline solution, as it shortens significantly the spectrum fatigue life of the implants. The quantitative scanning electron fractographic analysis indicates that all the tested implants grew fatigue cracks of similar lengths prior to catastrophic fracture. However, the average crack growth rate in the saline medium was found to largely exceed that in other media, suggesting a decreased fracture toughness. The notion of a characteristic timescale for environmental degradation was proposed to explain the results of our spectrum tests that blend randomly low and high cycle fatigue. Random spectrum fatigue testing is powerful technique to assess and compare the mechanical performance of dental implants for various designs and/or environments.},

  abstract        = {Severe plastic deformation (SPD) has long been known to confer superior mechanical properties for many metals and alloys. In the general field of biomedical devices, and dental implants in particular, the superior strength of SPD-processed commercially pure (CP) titanium, that may surpass that of the stronger Ti6Al4V alloy, has been associated with a superior fatigue resistance. Such a property would make those materials both biocompatible and strong alternatives to the currently used titanium alloy. However, the fatigue characterization reported so far in the literature relies on a very small sample size, thereby precluding any meaningful statistical analysis. This paper reports and compares systematic fatigue testing of various grades as-received and SPD processed Grade 4 CP-Ti using the recently developed random spectrum loading approach, in both air and 0.9% saline solution. The results of this study do not support the claim that the SPD process, albeit causing noticeable strengthening, confers any advantage to Grade 4 CP-Ti in terms of fatigue response.},

It also makes it clear that apparently everyone is still using Miners rule for damage accumulation, but it has clear inherent limitations that have to be considered.

Miners Rule was originally thought for Constant Amplitude loading. There it is still rather acceptable.

For Variable Amplitude loading, it more often than not leads to high discrepancy compared to test results.
IMPORTANT: At least an adaption of the original SN curve should be made to get rid of the fatigue endurance limit when using SN curves together with Variable Amplitude. See Haibach factor for it. Fig. 13 of this paper.

Summary:
Qualitative knowledge is very far and design for fatigue is therefore possible.
Quantitative knowledge still has a long way to go and therefore numerical predictions have to be taken with a lot of care and conservadorism (safety factors) for actual applications.},

Main insight/idea based on this paper would be to calculate the Kt via FEA (after singularity solved), then use the q-factor from some table for the material (for instance from this paper), the get the Kf from this and then use the Kf externally (APDL script or Python programm) to calculate the fatigue based on the SN Curve. Alternatively the Kf can be added in Ansys workbench using the generic, total K factor!},

  abstract        = {The process of adaptive bone remodeling can be described mathematically and simulated in a computer model, integrated with the finite element method. In the model discussed here, cortical and trabecular bone are described as continuous materials with variable density. The remodeling rule applied to simulate the remodeling process in each element individually is, in fact, an objective function for an optimization process, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a constant, preset value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the density. If an element in the structure cannot achieve that, it either turns to its maximal density (cortical bone) or resorbs completely. It is found that the solution obtained in generally a discontinuous patchwork. For a two-dimensional proximal femur model this patchwork shows a good resemblance with the density distribution of a real proximal femur. It is shown that the discontinuous end configuration is dictated by the nature of the differential equations describing the remodeling process. This process can be considered as a nonlinear dynamical system with many degrees of freedom, which behaves divergent relative to the objective, leading to many possible solutions. The precise solution is dependent on the parameters in the remodeling rule, the load and the initial conditions. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing, denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even more dense. It is suggested that this positive feedback of the attractor state (the strain energy field) creates order in the end configuration. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass, perhaps a minimal-mass structure, although this is no explicit objective in the optimization process. It is hypothesized that trabecular bone is a chaotically ordered structure which can be considered as a fractal with characteristics of optimal mechanical resistance and minimal mass, of which the actual morphology depends on the local (internal) loading characteristics, the sensor-cell density and the degree of mineralization.},

  abstract        = {Although the capacity of bone to adapt to functional mechanical requirements has been known for more than a century, it is still unclear how the bone adaptation processes are regulated. We hypothesize that osteocytes are sensitive to mechanical loading and control the regulation of bone mass in their environment. Recently, simulation models of such a process were developed, using the finite element method. It was discovered that these models produce discontinuous structures, not unlike trabecular bone. However, it was also found that severe discontinuities violate the continuum assumption underlying the finite element method and that the solutions were element mesh dependent. We have developed a simulation model (which is physiologically and mechanically more consistent) which maintains the self-organizational characteristics but does not produce these discontinuities. This was accomplished by separating the sensor density and range of action from the mesh. The results clearly show that predicted trabecular morphology, i.e. sizes and branching of struts, depend on the actual relationship between local load, sensor density and range of influence. We believe that the model is suitable to study the relationship between trabecular morphology and load and can also explain adaptation of morphology, in the sense of 'Wolff's law'.},
