# Pympo
Finite Element Calculation of Dental Implants considering Metal Fatigue and Bone Remodeling

**Pympo** is a Python program for the finite element analysis of dental implants
considering bone remodeling and implant fatigue.
It uses extensively the package [PyAnsys/PyMAPDL](https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/)
to connect with the [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program.
